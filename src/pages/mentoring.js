    <h1>Mentoring</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a strong believer in mentoring and mentorship programs. I think the
      number one priority for a self-starter or for anyone who wants to join the
      world of software engineering, is to find a mentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mentor would be someone that can guide you through the initial stages of
      your career, or someone who can help you overcome difficulties and career
      challenges at any stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm open to offering support to people in the community on a number of
      topics, ranging from the fundamentals of web development, to React and the
      modern frontend environment and to non-technical subjects like public
      speaking and technical writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not intend to charge money for this activity, but you should consider
      the fact that my time is limited and I might not be able to respond to
      everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are looking for some guidance in any of the above, give me a shout
      on any channel and we'll take it from there.
